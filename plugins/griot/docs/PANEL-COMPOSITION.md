# Panel composition

This file is the panel-assembly spec for the `evaluator-*` family. It
documents how an antagonist panel is composed from an artifact's file
list (auto-derivation), the precedence order used for overlap
resolution, and the boundary between the two most-likely-overlapping
domain evaluators (tokens and naming).

It is **not** a callable agent. There is no frontmatter — the agent
loader skips files without a `name:` field, so spawning
`subagent_type: PANEL-COMPOSITION` is not a thing. Sibling docs that
follow the same pattern: `evaluator-base.md` (which DOES have a `name:`
field but explicitly disclaims being normally callable) and the future
`griot-base.md` family doc.

Three audiences read this file:

- `/ev-loop-interactive` and `/ev-loop-confidence` skills, at the
  auto-derivation step where a panel is assembled from the unit's
  changed/created files. The skill body's prose (or a helper script
  it shells out to) follows the algorithm in § "How auto-derivation
  reads this spec".
- `/guild-validate`, when it aggregates findings from a multi-
  evaluator panel and needs an ordering to dedup overlapping
  findings. The precedence list in § "Precedence" is the source of
  truth.
- Humans authoring panels manually (custom one-off invocations,
  whiteboard-style "let me get a second lens on this") who want to
  know which evaluators to include for a given file set.

## File-type → evaluator mapping

The composer walks every changed or created file in the unit's
artifact and, for each, adds the evaluators below to the panel set.
The set is a `Set` — adding the same evaluator twice from two
different files is a no-op.

| File pattern | Evaluators added |
|--------------|------------------|
| `(any file)` | `evaluator-contract-fit` (baseline, always included) |
| `*.tsx`, `*.jsx` | `evaluator-react`, `evaluator-naming`, `evaluator-a11y` (when the JSX renders visible UI), `evaluator-nextjs` (when the file is Next-aware: a route file like `app/**/page.tsx`, contains `'use client'` directive, or exports `getServerSideProps` / `getStaticProps` / `generateMetadata` / `loader` / `action`) |
| `*.ts` (non-JSX) | `evaluator-react` (only when the file imports from `react` or `react-dom`), `evaluator-naming` |
| `*.module.css` | `evaluator-tokens`, `evaluator-naming` (class names are public API surface for the colocated component) |
| `*.css` (non-module, e.g. `globals.css`, `tokens.css`) | `evaluator-tokens` (caveat: each evaluator's own carve-outs handle source-of-truth files; the composer still adds the lens) |
| Files under `sketches/` | Same mapping as `*.tsx` based on extension; trust each evaluator's `sketches/`-specific carve-outs to suppress flags on p5 idioms (single-letter math vars, `setup`/`draw` callbacks, intentional literal colors as artistic statement) |
| `*.md` | `evaluator-contract-fit` only — domain evaluators don't apply to prose documents |
| `*.json`, `package.json`, lock files | `evaluator-contract-fit` only |
| `plugins/**/agents/*.md`, `plugins/**/skills/**/SKILL.md`, `projects/**/checkins/**/*.md` | `evaluator-contract-fit` only — this is substrate authoring; domain evaluators don't apply to agent definitions, skill bodies, or checkin files |
| `scripts/**/*.ts`, `plugins/**/scripts/**/*.ts` (substrate scripts) | `evaluator-contract-fit`, `evaluator-naming` (script identifiers / function names are public-API surface for substrate consumers) |
| `scripts/**/*.test.ts`, `plugins/**/scripts/**/*.test.ts` (substrate script tests) | `evaluator-test-unit` — vitest antipattern catalog applies; the naming evaluator's `test files` carve-out still applies |
| `plugins/**/cli/**/*.ts` (substrate CLI) | `evaluator-contract-fit`, `evaluator-naming` — same rationale as substrate scripts; CLI verb names + exported types are public-API surface for loops and humans |
| `plugins/**/cli/**/*.test.ts` (substrate CLI tests) | `evaluator-test-unit` — vitest antipattern catalog applies; same rationale as substrate scripts |
| `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.spec.tsx` (general test files; more-specific paths below override) | `evaluator-test-unit` — vitest unit-test antipattern catalog |
| `tests/e2e/**`, `tests/integration/**`, `e2e/**` | `evaluator-test-integration` — Playwright integration-test antipattern catalog; the `tests/e2e/a11y/**` subtree overrides below |
| `tests/e2e/a11y/**` | `evaluator-a11y` — a11y test specs run via `playwright.config.a11y.ts` are accessibility's lane, not test-integration's |

### Union rule

When an artifact touches multiple file types, the composed panel is
the **union** of per-file evaluator sets, plus the always-on
`evaluator-contract-fit`. Duplicates dedup to one entry per
evaluator. Order follows the precedence list below (not the order
files were encountered) so `/guild-validate`'s spawn step gets a
deterministic ordering.

Example: a unit that creates one `.tsx` and one `.module.css` and
modifies one `package.json` composes to:
`[evaluator-contract-fit, evaluator-a11y, evaluator-nextjs?,
evaluator-react, evaluator-tokens, evaluator-naming]` — where
`evaluator-nextjs` is conditional on the `.tsx` being Next-aware.

### When the panel reduces to just contract-fit

If every changed file falls in a "contract-fit only" bucket
(substrate authoring, project docs, lockfiles), the composed panel
is `[evaluator-contract-fit]` — the same single-agent panel
`/ev-loop-*` skills run today. The auto-derivation degrades
gracefully to the current behavior when no domain lens applies.

## Precedence

The ordered list below determines (a) the spawn order
`/guild-validate` passes to `/guild-spawn`, and (b) the dedup winner
when two evaluators flag the same `file:line` with compatible
remedies. Higher position = higher precedence.

1. **`evaluator-contract-fit`** — the baseline. Contract
   violations trump every domain concern: if the unit's acceptance
   criteria aren't met, no domain finding matters until the
   contract holds.
2. **`evaluator-a11y`** — accessibility outcomes have real user
   impact. A flag here represents harm to a real person using the
   product; that beats every aesthetic or framework concern.
3. **`evaluator-nextjs`** — framework correctness. If Next-specific
   patterns are wrong (hydration mismatch, missing `'use client'`,
   incorrect route export shapes), the artifact may not run at all
   in production. High stakes, but downstream of a11y because the
   broken artifact may still build.
4. **`evaluator-css-architecture`** (Phase 4 specialist) —
   structural CSS correctness when paired with the
   write-capable css-architecture postures
   (`implementer-css-architecture` / `fixer-css-architecture`).
   Selector specificity, cascade
   behavior, composition vs. duplication, `:global` leakage,
   shared-primitive bypass, sketch-CSS load-bearing-pattern
   regressions. Elevated precedence over `evaluator-react`
   because cascade fragility produces visual breakage; bumped
   below `evaluator-nextjs` because a build that won't ship is
   more urgent than one that ships fragile.
5. **`evaluator-react`** — runtime correctness within React
   itself (hooks rules, state mutation, ref-in-render). These don't
   crash the build but produce subtle runtime bugs.
6. **`evaluator-test-integration`** — integration-test correctness
   in production-shipped test code. Bad fixtures, parallel-unsafe
   state, hardcoded waits produce false confidence — a green suite
   that doesn't catch real user-facing regressions. Above tokens
   because false-confidence regressions ship to users; below
   react because the test harness itself doesn't run in
   production.
7. **`evaluator-test-unit`** — unit-test correctness in
   production-shipped test code. Mock-vs-real boundaries, isolation
   failures, focused/skipped tests. Lower than integration tests
   because unit-test antipatterns mask narrower failure modes (a
   single function's behavior) than integration-test antipatterns
   (a whole user flow).
8. **`evaluator-tokens`** — design-system drift. Bypassing the
   token system doesn't break the artifact at runtime, but it
   drifts the visual system over time.
9. **`evaluator-naming`** — rhetoric and readability. The lowest-
   stakes lens in the panel; flags here affect how code reads, not
   whether it works.

**Rationale for the ordering**: blast radius. Contract failures are
unit-fatal. Accessibility failures harm users. Framework breakage
prevents shipping. CSS-architecture fragility produces visual
breakage on shipped code. Runtime correctness produces hidden bugs.
Test-suite antipatterns produce false confidence (integration above
unit because broader scope masks more). Token drift degrades the
visual system. Naming affects comprehension. Each step down the
list is a smaller blast radius.

### Conflict vs overlap

These are different operations on the panel result:

- **Overlap** (compatible remedies on the same scope): the
  higher-precedence evaluator's finding wins; the lower's is
  suppressed in the consolidated list. Both evaluators ran and
  saw the same thing; the panel speaks with the higher-precedence
  voice to avoid reviewer noise.
- **Conflict** (incompatible remedies on the same scope, where
  applying both would brick the artifact): this is `flagged-
  conflict` per `/guild-validate`'s aggregation rules. v1 of
  `/guild-validate` documents this as a future-work case (real
  implementation deferred until a conflict actually shows up in
  practice). When it does, this section gets a concrete resolution
  policy — until then, precedence resolves the easy cases and
  conflicts surface for human review.

## Tokens-vs-naming-vs-architecture three-way boundary

Three evaluators can flag the same `.module.css` line:
`evaluator-tokens` (Phase 2 D4), `evaluator-naming` (Phase 2 D5),
and `evaluator-css-architecture` (Phase 4). The boundary among the
three is consolidated here.

The clean test, when a single line could match more than one
evaluator's catalog:

- **"This line should use a token instead of a literal"** →
  `evaluator-tokens`. The artifact is using `#ff0000` where a
  `token(...)` would apply.
- **"This token is the wrong name for the role"** →
  `evaluator-naming`. The artifact uses `token("color.gray.200")`
  where `token("color.background.surface")` is the semantic
  choice.
- **"This line's selector / cascade / structure will fight the
  rest of the file or codebase"** →
  `evaluator-css-architecture`. The artifact's structural shape
  is fragile, regardless of which tokens or names it uses.

The vocabulary axis (tokens) and the right-name axis (naming) are
upstream of the structure axis (architecture). Architecture
assumes vocabulary is correct and grades the *shape* of the CSS
that uses it.

When two evaluators flag the same scope with compatible remedies,
**`evaluator-css-architecture` wins overlap-resolution** when
paired with the write-capable css-architecture postures
(`implementer-css-architecture` / `fixer-css-architecture`, its
elevated-precedence pairing); otherwise, the precedence list above
resolves the tie.

### Tokens-vs-naming sub-boundary

The original two-way boundary between `evaluator-tokens` (D4) and
`evaluator-naming` (D5) — these are the two evaluators that
overlap most often on artifact lines independent of codemod work.

### D4 owns the literal-vs-token decision

Is the artifact using ANY token vs a hardcoded literal value?

| Pattern | Flag |
|---------|------|
| `color: #ff0000;` in a `.module.css` | `tokens-hex-literal` |
| `color: red;` in a `.module.css` | `tokens-named-color` |
| `padding: 16px;` where `token("space.xN")` exists | `tokens-hardcoded-spacing` |
| `font-size: 14px;` where `token("fontFamily.*")` / size tokens exist | `tokens-hardcoded-typography` |
| `@media (min-width: 588px)` instead of `map-breakpoints()` | `tokens-hardcoded-breakpoint` |
| `style={{ color: '#abc', padding: 16 }}` in JSX | `tokens-inline-literal-style` |
| Runtime `import { tokens } from '@/tokens'` for `style={}` use | `tokens-runtime-style-import` |

All seven D4 entries fire on **literals where a token would apply**.

### D5 owns the right-name decision and broader naming

Given two valid tokens (or two valid identifiers), which is
semantically correct? Plus identifier choices outside the token
system entirely.

| Pattern | Flag |
|---------|------|
| `token("color.gray.200")` where `token("color.background.surface")` is the semantic choice | `naming-visual-literal` |
| Component named `<BlueButton>` instead of `<PrimaryButton>` | `naming-visual-literal` |
| CSS Module class `.darkBar` where `.appHeader` is the semantic name | `naming-visual-literal` |
| New `<Container>` introduced when the established `<Area>` already covers the role | `naming-inconsistent-vocab` |
| `colorString`, `itemArray`, `iCount` | `naming-hungarian` |
| `<Section header>` boolean prop named as a noun instead of `<Section showHeader>` | `naming-boolean-form` |
| Exported `<Btn>` / `useMsg` / `fmt()` from a module | `naming-abbreviation-export` |
| Exported `useFormikSubmit` / `withMobxObserver` / `memoizedCache` | `naming-implementation-leak` |
| Sketch file named `mySketch.tsx` instead of `NN-slug.tsx`; component dir `pageHeader/` instead of `PageHeader/` | `naming-file-convention` |

D5 reaches well beyond the token system — component / hook / prop /
file / directory naming all live here.

### Concrete examples — which evaluator fires?

- `.module.css` rule using `color: #ff0000;` → **D4**
  (`tokens-hex-literal`). The artifact is using a literal where ANY
  token applies. D5 doesn't reach raw CSS-property values.

- `.module.css` rule using `color: token("color.gray.200");` where
  `token("color.background.surface")` is the semantic choice → **D5**
  (`naming-visual-literal`). The artifact IS using the token system;
  the name within the system is what's wrong.

- JSX `<BlueButton onClick={...}>` for a primary CTA → **D5**
  (`naming-visual-literal`). Component name describes appearance,
  not role. D4 doesn't reach JSX component names.

- New sketch file `sketches/sweepingLines.tsx` (camelCase instead
  of `NN-slug.tsx`) → **D5** (`naming-file-convention`). File
  naming. D4 has nothing to say.

- Inline `<div style={{ background: '#abc' }}>` in a `.tsx` →
  **D4** (`tokens-inline-literal-style`). Hardcoded literal where
  the design system would apply. D5 might also flag the prop
  shape (`style` on a div for design-system styling) but that's a
  composability concern, not a naming one.

## How auto-derivation reads this spec

D7 implements this; the algorithm follows directly from § "File-
type → evaluator mapping":

1. **Collect files.** Read the unit's changed and created files
   (the artifact summary's `Files` section or `git diff --name-
   only` against the base).
2. **Per-file lookup.** For each file, look up the applicable
   evaluator set from the table. Apply conditional rules (e.g.,
   `.ts` only adds `react` if the file imports `react`; `.tsx`
   only adds `nextjs` if Next-aware).
3. **Union.** Build the set of evaluators across all files.
4. **Always-include.** Add `evaluator-contract-fit` if not already
   present. (For unions over the table above, it always will be —
   `contract-fit` is the row-zero entry. The always-include step
   covers degenerate cases where the file list is empty.)
5. **Order.** Sort the resulting list by the precedence section
   above (highest precedence first). This is the agent list passed
   to `/guild-validate`.

The algorithm produces a single sorted list of evaluator
`subagent_type` names. `/ev-loop-*` passes it to `/guild-validate`
as the `agents=...` argument, replacing today's hardcoded
`agents: evaluator-contract-fit` line.

### Override and opt-out

Two escape hatches are available without touching this spec:

- **Per-phase override** in `PLAN.md`: a phase can name an explicit
  panel (`panel: [evaluator-contract-fit, evaluator-tokens]`) that
  overrides auto-derivation for every unit in the phase. Useful
  for phases doing focused work where auto-derivation would
  over-include lenses that consume budget without adding signal.
- **Per-unit override** in the contract: a unit's contract can
  add a `Panel:` line naming evaluators that should be added or
  removed from the auto-derived list (e.g., `Panel: +evaluator-
  css-architecture` to add a specialist, `Panel: -evaluator-
  nextjs` to suppress a lens). For when to actually reach for
  the override (verdict-padding on judgment-heavy units,
  mechanical-unit minimization), see § When to opt out: per-unit
  Panel: override below.

## When to opt out: per-unit Panel: override

The auto-derived panel is a default, not a mandate. Judgment-heavy
units — new abstractions, API surfaces, schema work — often see
**verdict-padding**: each evaluator in the panel cycles its full
rubric in the verdict prose even when only 2-3 dimensions are
actually load-bearing for the unit. The operator reads through
irrelevant "no findings in [dimension]" sections looking for the
load-bearing findings. The signal is buried, the attention tax is
real, and the contract didn't anticipate it because the panel
shape is set by the file types touched, not by the unit's intent.

The per-unit `Panel:` override in the contract is the substrate's
existing answer. A unit whose intent is narrowly mechanical — a
rename, a literal codemod, a small refactor — can declare the
panel it actually needs and skip the rest. Use it when the unit's
acceptance criteria genuinely cover only one or two dimensions and
the rest of the auto-derived panel would just produce no-findings
prose. Don't reach for it when the unit is genuinely
multi-dimensional and you want each evaluator to confirm the
absence of concerns in its lens (the no-findings prose is then the
confidence signal, not noise).

Copy-pasteable example for a mechanical unit (e.g. a file rename
or a literal-value extraction):

```
Panel: [evaluator-contract-fit]
```

That single line in the unit's contract instructs `/ev-loop-*` to
pass that exact `agents=` list to `/guild-validate`, bypassing
auto-derivation entirely. For an additive narrowing (keep the
auto-derived panel but explicitly add or remove one evaluator),
use the `+` / `-` syntax from § Override and opt-out above:

```
Panel: +evaluator-css-architecture
Panel: -evaluator-nextjs
```

One thing to keep in mind when narrowing: the verdict's exhaustive
prose IS a confidence signal — "I checked dimension X and found
nothing" tells the operator the dimension was actually examined.
Narrowing the panel narrows that signal too. Use the override
when you're sure the dimensions you're dropping aren't ones a
future reviewer would want positive confirmation on. When in
doubt, accept the padding.

See § Override and opt-out for the underlying spec and the
per-phase variant for plan-level overrides.

## Cross-references

Each domain evaluator has its own "Boundary with adjacent
evaluators" section that covers the per-evaluator nuance:

- `.claude/agents/evaluator-a11y.md` — boundary with tokens
  (contrast vs literal-vs-token) and react (semantic HTML vs
  hook usage)
- `.claude/agents/evaluator-nextjs.md` — boundary with react
  (framework vs runtime correctness) and naming (library-imposed
  names carve-out)
- `.claude/agents/evaluator-react.md` — boundary with nextjs
  (runtime vs framework) and naming (API surface vs identifier
  choice)
- `.claude/agents/evaluator-test-integration.md` — boundary with
  a11y (axe-core scans defer to a11y; test shape stays here),
  test-unit (tier choice at file boundary), react (fixture
  components), and whiteboard-testing-strategy (design vs review
  phase)
- `.claude/agents/evaluator-test-unit.md` — boundary with
  test-integration (tier choice), naming (test-file naming
  carve-out), react (production code under test), and
  whiteboard-testing-strategy (design vs review phase)
- `.claude/agents/evaluator-tokens.md` — boundary with naming
  (literal-vs-token vs right-name) and a11y (contrast outcomes)
- `.claude/agents/evaluator-naming.md` — boundary with tokens
  (right-name vs literal-vs-token) and the other three lenses

The per-evaluator sections remain the source of truth for their
own boundary text. This file consolidates the cross-cutting
view and is the source of truth for **panel-level** decisions
(composition, precedence, conflict policy).
